            <h4>Elopements</h4>
            <p> 
              We love capturing weddings, but as a bride and groom who have planned 2 weddings (thanks Covid), wedding photographer and videographer, and husband and wife we originally eloped, we adore elopements!
              Hear us out, weddings are great and it's so much fun to celebrate with family and friends, but with elopements, you get the most intimate and cherishable moment between eachother.
              Elopements can be raw, genuine, tear filled, full of laughter and stress-free, not to mention, they are much cheaper! 
              Elopements can be done with the most important people in your life, like te bride and groom, parents, friends, close relatives, or anyone who you couldnt imagine getting married without.
              With elopements being so small, we can help with so much more than just breathtaking photos and videos, we can help you plan the event, with flowers, day of plans and decorations!
              Instead of hiring a team of 4-7 people, you could get a team of 2-3 people, making this day so much more intimate for you and less stressful!
              Not to mention, with elopements, you can choose a beautiful destination, whether its in Co, or wherever you would like! 
              Whether it's 30 minutes away from denver or 6 hours away, we love travel and would love to assist you!

              <p> Our main job and priority from the buisness side of things is to make our couples feel comfortable and giving a great experiance.
                We strive to get some kind of connection on our shoots, so we are not complete strangers who show up, take your money, tell you to smile and leave. 
                This is just as much our experiance as it is yours, and we would like to leave as friends instead of "that one photographer and videographer."
