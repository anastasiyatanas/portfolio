              <h4>About us!</h4>
              <p> My amazing husband and I are newly weds, I am the primary photographer and photo editor! 
                 My talented husbands, Artem is the primary videographer! 
                 We had a wedding in March that was postponed due to Covid. 
                 We decided to elope, as we loved eachother so much and wanted to be with eachother ever minute of every day. 
                 We eventually were able to have our wedding at one of our parents houses in October, it was such an amazing day!
                 We understand how hard it is to find a photographer and videographer, and we want to help others to make the process a lot smoother and easier!
                 We also understand how stressful planning a wedding can be, read why we love elopments <a href="services.html">here!</a>

          <h4>Anastasiya (Ana)</h4>
          <p> My name's Anastasiya but I go by Ana for short! 
            I'm your average 22 year old who loves photography!
            I'm also an extreme cat lady, who loves her "FRIENDS" and "The Office."
            I'm also an extreme nerd when it comes to Mythology, Theology and Philosophy (start talking to me about it and I will NOT shut up.) 
            I started playing with photography about 5 years ago, going on fun photoshoots with friends, and taking pictures for my church!
            My favorite memories include hiking at 3 a.m. to get those beautiful Colorado sunset photos with my adventurous friend, who is also a photographer and took this photo! 
            I also love traveling, I've been to more then 7 countries and my favorite traveling experiance was going to Iceland and traveling the Ring Road for two weeks (also with my adventurous friend!)

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
